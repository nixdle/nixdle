/tmp/nixdle.lock contains the date returned from the server, the number of max attempts and current
attempts with the words inputted

on connect, the server returns: nix commit, date, version, attempt url, number of possible lib path parts, attempts needed to get a part
on each attempt, returns date, if successful
if successful, returns word, description, cli deletes the lock file
if not, current path parts, if number of args in guessed is more, less or equal to needed, if from or to matches

the lock file HAS to be hashed with the nix commit to avoid tampering

standalone non-server version maybe someday

check if guessed is same as needed alias
