this is stuff that's on the radar but not currently being worked on
if you want to help out, open a PR or an issue !!!!!!!!!

lib:
- write unit tests
- better error handling (see cli's thiserror implementation)
- add logging with tracing
- improve documentation (add embedded examples too)
- optimize function filtering & signature parsing

cli:
- figure out how the FUCK does overriding default `--help` & `--version` descriptions work in clap
- do something about the ^C panic when inputting data
- implement arrow up/down completion
- find a more maintainable way of displaying stats/attempt data

i think that's it for now
if you have any other ideas or suggestions, you know what to do !!!!
