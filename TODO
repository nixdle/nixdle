this is stuff that's on the radar but not currently being worked on
if you want to help out, open a PR or an issue !!!!!!!!!

lib:
- write unit tests
- implement better error handling
- add logging with tracing
- improve documentation (add embedded examples too)

i think that's it for now
if you have any other ideas or suggestions, you know what to do !!!!
